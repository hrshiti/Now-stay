CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY

Last Updated: February 2026

At NowStay, we understand that plans can change. This Cancellation and Refund Policy outlines the terms under which you can cancel your booking and request a refund.

1. STANDARD CANCELLATION POLICY
- Free Cancellation: Guests can cancel their booking free of charge up to 24 hours before the scheduled check-in time.
- Late Cancellation: Cancellations made within 24 hours of the scheduled check-in time are non-refundable. The total price of the reservation will be charged.
- No-Show: If you do not arrive at the property on the scheduled check-in date ("No-Show"), the entire booking amount will be forfeited, and no refund will be issued.

2. NON-REFUNDABLE BOOKINGS
Some bookings, particularly those made under special promotional offers or discounted rates, may be non-refundable. This will be clearly stated at the time of booking. For non-refundable bookings, no refund will be issued upon cancellation or modification.

3. REFUND PROCESS
- If you are eligible for a refund based on the cancellation policy applicable to your booking, the refund amount will be credited to the original payment method used during the booking.
- Refunds are typically processed within 5-7 business days. However, depending on your bank or credit card issuer, it may take additional time for the funds to reflect in your account.

4. MODIFICATIONS TO BOOKINGS
- Modifications to booking dates, room types, or number of guests are subject to availability and may result in a change in the total booking price.
- If the modified booking price is higher than the original booking price, you will be required to pay the difference.
- If the modified booking price is lower than the original booking price, the difference will be refunded in accordance with our refund policy, provided the modification is made outside the cancellation window.

5. FORCE MAJEURE
In the event of unforeseen circumstances or force majeure events (e.g., natural disasters, government restrictions, pandemics) preventing the property from hosting you, NowStay reserves the right to cancel the booking and issue a full refund or provide a credit for future bookings.
